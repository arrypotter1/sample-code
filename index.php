<h1>Hello AWS!</h1>
<p>I was tasked with an assignment to build a AMI. What I wanted to do was to think beyond, to think bold and solve a global problem. The problem I choose was based on <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/sme/8-crore-retail-wholesale-traders-incur-rs-6-25-lakh-cr-business-loss-due-to-covid-restrictions/2248611/" target="_blank"	>this article</a>  </br>

<p> India was one of the most severly affected countries due to COVID and <font color="blue"><b>80 MN Retailers in India and 90 BN loss</b></font> today have incurred losses, with several of them having to shut down. A major concern with them was they did not have a "Digital Platform". When the pandemic stuck, they had no option but to shut down </p>

<p> My goal was - what if there was a E-Commerce solution that allowed these small retailers to stay relevant and not having to shut down their operations. 

I worked on the solution, learnt several concepts, failed, learnt and improve my solution</br>
1. Packer deployed, Docker enabled E-Commerce built on PHP (had mysql, was not able to deploy it due to performance issues)</br>
2. CIS Security 1 enabled </br>
3. Built to run on t2.micro </br>
I have done testing on it for security, accessiblity and performance
